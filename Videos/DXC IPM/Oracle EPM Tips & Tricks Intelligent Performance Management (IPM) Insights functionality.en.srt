2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
hi everyone my name's debbie king and

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
here with me today is gary westcott and

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,639
steve hichman and we're all really

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,599
excited to bring you a taste of the new

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
insights functionality that's within the

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
intelligent performance management

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,199
oracle solution

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,800
this has been actually delivered to you

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
in the november release for all of our

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
epm enterprise

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
solution

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,000
clients

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
so before we jump into the tool we're

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
going to just talk talk through the

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,719
evolution of planning and you may your

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,960
organization may be at any stage on this

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
evolutionary

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,879
line but a lot will have started with

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,120
and possibly still use manual or excel

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,680
methods to do your planning

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
that's been improved over time with

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,960
driver-based and historical trend

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
analysis to try and ac more accurately

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
get to where your forecast needs to be

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
but that can still take time with a lot

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
of data particularly if you're still

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,199
using manual methods to do that

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,438
auto predict is the functionality where

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
you can look at historical information

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,119
to predict where you are in the future

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,760
which has been evolving um really

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
quickly but where we're at today and

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,000
what we want to jump into

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
is where machine learning prediction

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
is is going to help us out to get to

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,360
that nirvana that we often talk about of

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
a zero touch forecast but at the very

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,759
least to get a light touch and more

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
accurate and fast forecasting and

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
budgeting

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
outcome for your organization

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,159
so

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,000
just in line with that evolution what

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
technology providers have been trying to

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
do is actually originally give

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,920
give the accountants give the people

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
more time to analyze the data and

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
i mean that's been great and it has had

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,240
a lot of benefit but as you can see just

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
from this very simple

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,079
um chart of account

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
combination here so think about 200

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
accounts 100 entities

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,479
50 products 100 customers it's 100

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
million data combinations that you would

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,878
have to have a look at to find where

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,760
variances might be and

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
as highlighted here if you have um

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,720
something materially over in sydney or

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,959
and under in melbourne it'll be needle

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
in a haystack stuff trying to get down

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
to that variance and often you'll just

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
skip over it and look at things at a

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
higher level so

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,959
machine

67
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
learning this particular tool is going

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,599
to help us out by providing those that

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
analysis and then we can look at the

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,510
analysis in a bit more detail

71
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,519
[Music]

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,920
the insights functionality is built on

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,760
the cornerstone of

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
is predictive planning is cornerstone of

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
this functionality so that's the

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,519
foundation of how this inside stuff's

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,120
been working

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,440
and you actually have had

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,519
the if with the planning tool um

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
predictive planning has been available

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,519
for some time

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,640
and

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
i guess insights just takes that to the

84
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
to the next level where you

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,840
are shown the inside behind some of that

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,720
prediction so

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
before we

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
actually jump in and have a look at the

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
tool

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,560
in play so gary's standing by there's

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
just a few things you need to know this

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,080
was

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
as i said before delivered in the

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
november release so ready at your

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
fingertips it is for epm enterprise

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
customers only and you do need the red

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
wood theme

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,959
required and i think we've said that and

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
steve online has said that at quite a

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,159
few of these

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,440
um

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,920
information sessions where you get more

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
functionality by enabling the redwood

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,640
theme and it's necessary for ipm

105
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
the navigation flows very cute little

106
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,440
artificial intelligent robot um to guide

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
you through to where insights will live

108
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
but i think importantly and you'll see

109
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
it in the tool

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,959
plain english user-friendly um end user

111
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
focused insights to then have a look at

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,120
and

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
you can determine whether or not you

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
want to use that prediction

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
very nice clean um graphical

116
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,560
user interface as well so without me

117
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
just talking about it i'm going to hand

118
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
over to gary to show you the tool in

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
action so thanks gary thanks debbie

120
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
so we're open at the home screen and to

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,120
get to the insights you click on the ipm

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
navigation flow

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,199
and go to insights

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
and so there are a number of insights

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,960
that come up when you go to the inside

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
screen and as you can see we've got

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,919
there's multiple types of insights and

128
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,000
but and that's going to grow but we've

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
got i'm only showing two of them and the

130
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
two i'm showing you guys the forecast

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,680
variants and buyers which is just

132
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
relates to the material differences in

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
actual versus forecast but the one i'm

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
really going to concentrate on is the

135
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
prediction insight which so here you can

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
see we've got two prediction insights

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,560
one for sydney one for melbourne

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
melbourne is

139
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,000
um lower than the forecast and sydney is

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
higher than the forecast so as debbie

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
said at a higher level that they're

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,639
going to negate each other out so you

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,080
may not actually see that if you're just

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,800
doing your analysis at a um aggregate

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,919
level

146
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,440
so i'll go and click into the sydney

147
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
insight

148
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
okay so for the sydney insight you can

149
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
see that there are two lines here one

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
sub-base prediction and the other one's

151
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
are forecast the base prediction is the

152
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
actual machine learning what it's

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
actually predicting the forecast should

154
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,039
be and as you can see it's got some

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
seasonality in it

156
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
which our forecast which we use during

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
doing our driver models or inputting

158
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,880
hasn't got so

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
it

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
has actually done a good job of

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
forecasting so you can actually see the

162
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
dollar amounts down here as well so you

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
can say okay you've forecasted 400k flat

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,320
but the actual base prediction is using

165
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
has come up with a different amount so

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
it is about actually 26 higher than what

167
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
you forecast

168
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,000
you can actually

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
go over and update this forecast if you

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
wanted to

171
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,039
so you can add comments when you do it

172
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
you can dismiss the inside if you don't

173
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,840
think it's materially different or you

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,319
and or you can open as an ad hoc form

175
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,479
you can also do an override once you've

176
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,880
updated the forecast and to say okay you

177
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
still want to have a little bit of a

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,759
difference there so you can actually do

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,199
an override so i'm just going to update

180
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
the forecast

181
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520
and oh you can actually write a comment

182
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
there but i won't

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
and now you can see there's only one

184
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
line that's because the forecast and the

185
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,639
base prediction have now become the same

186
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
so you've updated your forecast

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
below so now you've got the machine

188
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
learning

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
so how do you configure that you go up

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
to the top screen to do the configure

191
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,319
and i'll click on the one i've called

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
predict

193
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,759
and see this one i've chosen for auto

194
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,720
predict and prediction insights

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
and to define the slice you can

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
go into the define size so this shows

197
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
that you're using actuals and you can

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
say how many historical years do you

199
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,800
want to use you can use

200
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
four if you want to five three depending

201
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
on how much many actuals you've got and

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
the other side just shows the forecast

203
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,318
data and what you're going to predict

204
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
so you go to configure

205
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
what we're doing is saying okay you

206
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
should come up as an insight if the

207
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,360
threshold of variance is more than 12

208
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
if it's not then it doesn't come up so

209
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,319
you can also have advanced insights for

210
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,840
the data scientists out there which

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
shows actual different metrics that you

212
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,759
can use to calculate that

213
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,360
but i'm just sticking to the simple

214
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
basic 12 percent

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
next you go to settings

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,280
so the settings one shows the magnitude

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,599
of the threshold so if you're saying

218
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
okay there's a 30 increase you're going

219
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,360
to put that as high if you've got a 10

220
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
percent increase that's low so that just

221
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
shows

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
what which ones you can going to sit at

223
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
higher so you can actually concentrate

224
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,720
on them more than the lower ones

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
so that's how you how you set up the

226
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,319
insight

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,280
you can you can also at the same time

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
oracle has released

229
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
machine learning models

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,919
so

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,680
this allows organizations to bring their

232
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
own model into

233
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
the system using their own machine

234
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,879
learning model so and you can just

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,400
import that in there as well

236
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
we'll hand over to steve to wrap it up

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
from here

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
thank you gary so steve speaking um

239
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
we we're pretty excited about this

240
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
functionality which has sort of been in

241
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,120
the making um for a little while there's

242
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
been a number of kind of foundational

243
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
blocks and this is really starting to

244
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,839
show

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
sort of a significant peak into the

246
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,600
future so it's good already

247
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
there's more to come

248
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
as you kind of hopefully saw very easy

249
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
to use very much targeted at the

250
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
business unit user

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
trying to simplify and

252
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,959
add efficiency

253
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,360
if you would like to know more there's a

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
couple of customer connect sessions

255
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
highlighted there both of them are

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,399
approximately an hour of time including

257
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,080
a bit more on the bring your own machine

258
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
learning that gary very briefly touched

259
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,800
on

260
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,839
and or feel free to reach out to us for

261
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,500
more information thank you very much
